# Census Income Prediction

Income prediction also helps to identify those individuals who are of a lower income that may need the most assistance. The ability to predict the income of individuals from this information has far-reaching impacts for every industry. 
The data for our project was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker. The problem statement of this project is to identify the dataset feature or features which are mostly related to or affecting the income of a household. 

# Repository

This repo has the code on jupyter notebook, a white paper explaining the analysis process and final outcomes.

# Dataset

The dataset is extracted from Kaggle website. 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income  


# Modeling 

The dataset was analyzed through the EDA process. Then the dataset was prepped for modeling.
The modeling algorithms that were considered were Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier.
For Feature selection, different methods were considered to derive the 5 best features to improve the accuracy of the models.

# Pre-requisites

Ensure Python3 is installed.
Depending on the code requirements, you may need to install packages before importing them in the code.

Since this is a jupyter notebook, ensure you have a jupyter environment/interface available.

# Execution

Once the pre-requisites are taken care of, please follow the below steps - 
1. Download the jupyter notebook and open in your jupyter environment
2. Download the datasets from above mentioned repo
3. Update the code to your path where the datafiles are saved
4. Execute each cell of the notebook
5. Please note, the code could most definitely be improved in performance, model accuracy, and efficiency.
