# Heart Disease Analysis

The objecting of this project is to analyze the different factors that may contribute to the health of the heart and build a prediction model that can predict heart diseases in patients. The accurate prediction will help in identifying health issues in early stages and treating them in time.

# Repository

This repo has the code on jupyter notebook, a white paper explaining the analysis process and final outcomes.

# Dataset

The dataset is extracted from Kaggle website. 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease 

The dataset has multiple features - 
Categorical Features:
HeartDisease, Smoking, AlcoholDrinking, Stroke, DiffWalking, Sex, Race, Diabetic, 
PhysicalActivity, GenHealth, Asthma, KidneyDisease, SkinCancer
Continuous Features:
BMI, PhysicalHealth, MentalHealth, AgeCategory, SleepTime

# Modeling 

The dataset was analyzed through the EDA process. Then the dataset was prepped for modeling.
The modeling algorithms that were considered were Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and KNeighbors Classifier.

# Pre-requisites

Ensure Python3 is installed.
Depending on the code requirements, you may need to install packages before importing them in the code.

Since this is a jupyter notebook, ensure you have a jupyter environment/interface available.

# Execution

Once the pre-requisites are taken care of, please follow the below steps - 
1. Download the jupyter notebook and open in your jupyter environment
2. Download the datasets from above mentioned repo
3. Update the code to your path where the datafiles are saved
4. Execute each cell of the notebook
5. Please note, the code could most definitely be improved in performance, model accuracy, and efficiency.
