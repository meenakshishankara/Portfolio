# Time Series Modeling

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model for monthly retail sales.

# Repository

This repo has the code and write-up on the Time series Modeling.

# Dataset

The datasets for this project is available in the repo for usage.

# Pre-requisites

Ensure Python3 is installed. Depending on the code requirements, you may need to install packages before importing them in the code.

Since this is a jupyter notebook, ensure you have a jupyter environment/interface available. 

# Execution

Once the pre-requisites are taken care of, please follow the below steps -

1. Download the jupyter notebook and open in your jupyter environment
2. Download the datasets from above mentioned repo
3. Update the code to your path where the datafiles are saved
4. Execute each cell of the notebook
Please note, the code could most definitely be improved in performance, accuracy, and efficiency.
