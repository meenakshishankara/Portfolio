## Vegan and Vegetarian Restaurants in the US
The objective of this project is to analyze the rise of vegan and vegetarian restaurants across the US amidst fast food and other restaurants. 
For this analysis, I will be working with 3 datasets. The datasets provide the information related to restaurants and fast foods eateries 
which include the location, name, cuisine, categories, data added to the system etc. which will help us analyze across various factors

## Dataset
The first data source is a Flat File Source – Fast food across US downloaded from data.world.
https://data.world/datafiniti/fast-food-restaurants-across-america 

The second data source is Website data – data scraped from HappyCow.net.

The third data source API Data from Kaggle – list of Vegan and Veg restaurants across the US.

## Repository 
This repo has the code file, a white paper explaining the analysis process and final outcomes.

## Pre-requisites
Ensure Python3 is installed.
Depending on the code requirements, you may need to install packages before importing them in the code
Since this is a jupyter notebook, ensure you have a jupyter environment/interface available

## Execution
Once the pre-requisites are taken care of, please follow the below steps - 
1. Clone the repo or Download the jupyter notebook and open in your jupyter environment
2. Download the datasets from above mentioned repo
3. Update the code to your path where the datafiles are saved
4. Execute each cell of the notebook
5. This project focuses mainly on Data Cleaning and Preparation steps. For analysis, multiple Visualizations were created to explore and understand the data.
6. Please note the data was finally uploaded to a database using SQLite and was then queried using SQL.
7. It was a fun project. Hope you like it as well.
