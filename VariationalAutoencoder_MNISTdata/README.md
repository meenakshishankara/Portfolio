# Variational Autoencoder

The objective of this project is to implement a variational autoencoder using the MNIST data set and save a grid of 15 x 15 digits to the results/vae directory.

# Repository

This repo has the code and results of the Variational Autoencoder implementaion on MNIST data.

# Dataset

MNIST set is a large collection of handwritten digits. It is a very popular dataset in the field of image processing. It is often used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
This dataset is imported from Keras for this learning module.

# Pre-requisites

Ensure Python3 is installed. Depending on the code requirements, you may need to install packages before importing them in the code.

Since this is a jupyter notebook, ensure you have a jupyter environment/interface available. 

# Execution

Once the pre-requisites are taken care of, please follow the below steps -

1. Download the jupyter notebook and open in your jupyter environment
2. Download the datasets from above mentioned repo
3. Update the code to your path where the datafiles are saved
4. Execute each cell of the notebook
Please note, the code could most definitely be improved in performance, accuracy, and efficiency.
