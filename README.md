### 3.	World Happiness Report 
https://github.com/meenakshishankara/Portfolio/blob/main/WorldHappinessReport/README.md

The World Happiness Report gives happiness scores and ranking for each of the countries. This provides a valuable insight into the least and most happy countries and what contributes to their rankings. This research is my attempt to dig a little more into what contributes to general happiness and do the factors on which the survey was conducted indeed are factors to oneâ€™s happiness.

### 4.	Census Income Prediction 

Income prediction is important for a variety of areas in the private and nonprofit sectors. One critical area this affects is marketing, where income segmentation of the population is an extremely important tool. Income prediction helps to identify those individuals who are of a lower income that may need the most assistance, who some nonprofits strive to identify and assist. The ability to predict the income of individuals from this information has far-reaching impacts for every industry. In this project, we have explored the features impacting the income of a household.

### 5.	Airline Safety Analysis 

In this project, I have created a blog post and infographics to show airline safety and improvement. Various visualizations have been developed to narrate airline safety over other modes of transportation.

### 6.	Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction

Heart Disease is one of the major causes of death in the USA. Many factors contribute to the health of the heart. Understanding how different factors affect the heart can help in rectifying and making good choices to ensure a healthy heart and a long life. Although many factors influence the heart directly or indirectly, some of the most relevant factors are being captured in this dataset which include, Smoking, Alcohol consumption, General health, Physical and Mental health, Age, race, sleep patterns, other pre-existing diseases like diabetics, Kidney health, Asthma, Cancer etc. 
The objective of this project is to analyze the different factors that may contribute to the health of the heart and build a prediction model that can predict heart diseases in patients. Accurate prediction will help in identifying health issues in the early stages and treating them in time.
