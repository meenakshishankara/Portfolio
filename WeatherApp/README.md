# Weather App

The Weather App was one of the first projects that was coded in Python during my Masters in Data Science program. 
This app is interactive in the sense, the user enters a zipcode or a City name and the app returns the weather report for that place.

# Repository

This repo has the python code file.

# Dataset

The code makes an API call to the Open Weather Map along with the zipcode or the city name.

# Pre-requisites

The code for this app was created on pycharm. Ensure the appropriate version of Python is installed.
You may need to install the packages in case the import step in the code fails.

# Execution

1. Download the code and open the file in pycharm IDE.
2. You may need a working API key that one can receive from the openweathermap.org.
3. Update the API key in the code.
4. Save and run the code.
5. You will be asked to enter either a zipcode or a city name.
6. The weather report for that city will be printed on the screen.
