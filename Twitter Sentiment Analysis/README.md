# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Twitter Sentiment Analysis is important for understanding Customer Feedback, in reputation management, political analysis, crisis management, marketing research to name a few.
In this project, we try to implement NLP Twitter sentiment analysis models that help to overcome the challenges of sentiment classification of tweets. We will be building a model that will give us the most accurate prediction of the sentiment of the tweet.

# Repository

This repo has the code file, a white paper and presentation deck explaining the analysis process and final outcomes.

# Dataset

The dataset is extracted from Kaggle website. I am using twitter_training.csv as the training set and twitter_validation.csv as the validation set.

#Pre-requisites

Ensure Python3 is installed.
Depending on the code requirements, you may need to install packages before importing them in the code.

Since this is a jupyter notebook, ensure you have a jupyter environment/interface available.

# Execution

Once the pre-requisites are taken care of, please follow the below steps - 
1. Download the jupyter notebook and open in your jupyter environment
2. Download the datasets from above mentioned repo
3. Update the code to your path where the datafiles are saved
4. Execute each cell of the notebook
5. Please note, the code could most definitely be improved in performance, model accuracy, and efficiency.
